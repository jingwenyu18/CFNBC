# CFNBC
A Novel Collaborative Filtering Model for LncRNA-Disease Association Prediction Based on the NaiÌˆve Bayesian Classifier
# Requirement
MATLAB R2016a or later

# Run CFNBC
You can run main.m directly to obtain the predicted scores between LncRNAs and Diseases based on the data used in this paper. 

If you would like to perform this method with your own datasets, you need to process the data by using the function "get_new_association" first.

"CFNBC" is the main function to infer potential associations between LncRNAs and Diseases. 

"CFR.m" is the code of Collaborative Filtering algorithm used in CFNBC.
